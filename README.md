# OCI-Chatbot

I have developed a simple ChatBot using RAG (Retrieval augmented generation) with the help of Cohere command LLM model and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). I have integrated Chroma DB as a vector database for the application.

I have also deployed the application in Oracle Ubuntu VM.

Tools used:
1. Python
2. Oracle Cloud
3. LangChain
4. ChromaDB
5. FAISS
6. Oracle cloud Virtual VM.


Disclaimer:
The code might have similarity with the course provided by Oracle Cloud (https://mylearn.oracle.com/ou/course/oci-generative-ai-professional/136035/).
